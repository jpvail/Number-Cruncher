MagicDuos 

A magic duo is a pair of positive integers whose product consists of numbers in ascending order. For example, (7,7) is a magic dup since 7*7 = 49 and 4 < 9. 

During a google tech challenge, participants were tasked with finding the number of magic duos with a corresponding product that is less than 1000. To solve the problem, I built this java program which computes the number of magic duos in a passed-in array of integers.
